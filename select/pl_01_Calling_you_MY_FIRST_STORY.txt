I didn't know why I came so far
Was I blind or did I know this
wrong path
Ahead of my way you walked aways
That day I just go so sick of it
run away run away from the day I
gave up can't see you no more!
Are you ready Go!!Face your
desire!
What will I see?
Today I wont let you down!
Are you ready Go!!Face my
weekness!
I see your smiling face.
Tomorrow is a brand new day you
know!
You thought this was what you'd
always want
Or is this just only what you
wanted to want?
Lying to yourself consistency
But you know that can take you
no far
run away run away from the day I
gave up can't see you no more!
Are you ready Go!!Face your
desire!
What will I see?
Today I wont let you down!
Are you ready Go!!Face my
weekness!
I see your smiling face.
Tomorrow is a brand new day you
know!
Now the time!No more cry!
Get up now forget about that
sight!
I walk my way!
I walk my day!
Not comparing nor denying
You walk you way! You walk you
day!
yeah!go you own new way, will
take you far away!!
I'm here that's right
This is where I stand
I stand alone.
Don't look back just stareing
the way!
Are you ready Go!!Face your
desire!
What will I see?
that could be picture of you
Are you ready Go!!Face my
weekness!
I stop the call, when you find
the precious thing.one day
