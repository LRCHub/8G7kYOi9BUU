Don't tell them
They'll only drink your tears
Don't do it
Not in a hundred years

You know it, you feel it
I do too, just listen
Something is calling you

What difference
Do you think that it makes
If you give
Or if it's you who takes

I know it, I feel it
You do too, just listen
You'll hear it calling you

What difference
Do you think that it makes
If you give
Or if it's you who takes

I know it, I feel it
You do too, just listen
You'll hear me calling you
